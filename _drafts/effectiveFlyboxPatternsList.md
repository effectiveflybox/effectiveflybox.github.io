# The Patterns

The Effective Fly Box is my collection of a dozen flies that I can successfully use to fish for trout anywhere.  The patterns are *relatively* easy to tie with a minimal set of materials and tools.  They are intended be tied quickly in quantity requiring a minimum of pain-in-the-ass materials and/or techniques.
