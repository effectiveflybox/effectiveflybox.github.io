* Used a #6 Firehole #714 and was glad right away that I bought a size smaller for the next attempt.
* Going to build this hook + 3x 8mm shank + 15mm shank
* Have some Spirit River 7/32 Real Eyes and can't find the same anywhere.  Bought 4mm Flymen Living Eyes Fire to glue into them.
* Used 8mm SemperFli Camo Chenille for the tail/hook and went right to 15mm for the 8mm shanks.  I think I will use 4mm for the tail and maybe the first shank next time and build up to get more taper.
* Using UTC 70D thread and finding it to be a PITA.  Will go back to using Veevus.
