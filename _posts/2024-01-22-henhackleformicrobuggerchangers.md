* Choose 5 feather pairs, where the feathers roughly match each other and are successfully bigger.
* Smaller feathers come from the bottom of the saddle and get bigger as you move up.
* This isn't finesse work, you should be selecting five pairs of feathers in a couple of minutes at best.
* I use a piece of cardboard and a strip of painters tape to keep them paired up and not flying about.
