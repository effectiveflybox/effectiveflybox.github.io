I bought a few Semper Fli Game Changer kits, essentially a staggered assortment of their pearl chenille.  The goal was to use this to tie some game changers that wouldn't require the shaping that a single size of material would.  The kit comes with chenille in 30mm, 20mm, 10mm and 8mm sizes.  I bought packs of 3mm ad 1mm separately.  The kit also came with wire to connect a shank to a hook (perhaps too heavy) and adhesive eyes (perhaps too big).  I added to this a starter kit of Fish Skull Articulated Micro Spines.
